# CCC-Project

README

Step 01: Download files from the provided GitHub repository (should be called CCC-Project)

Step 02: Extract the files from the zip (use 7zip, WinRAR, or whatever else)

Step 03: Download Python (we installed Python 3.13). When setting up Python, make sure to check "Use admin privileges when installing py.exe" and "Add python.exe to PATH" on the initial window, then click install now. Once Python is installed, restart your computer.

Step 04: Open the windows command prompt (press the windows key and type "command prompt" then open it. You can also press the windows key + r, then type cmd, then press enter to open the command prompt)

Step 05: Type "cd downloads", press enter. We are trying to get the directory into the folder (called CCC-Project-main) where all the files from the GitHub repository are located.

Step 06: Type "cd CCC-Project-main", press enter.

Step 07: Type "dir", press enter. If there is another folder called "CCC-Project-main", type "cd CCC-Project-main" then press enter again.

Step 08: Type "pip install flask", press enter.

Step 09: Type "pip install pandas", press enter.

Step 10: Type "python main.py", press enter. If a Windows Security Alert windows pops up, check Public networks and allow access (I don't know which one to choose to be honest)

Step 11: From the command prompt terminal, copy the second bullet point's link (something like "http://127.0.0.1:3000") into your browser.

Step 12: Now you should be able to use the website! Some forms/textboxes will send received receipts to the terminal, and some won't as they don't work yet.
