README


* Before continuing, if you have any files called "CCC-Project-main" in your downloads please delete them. *


Step 01: Download files from the provided GitHub repository (should be called CCC-Project)

Step 02: Extract the files from the zip (use 7zip, WinRAR, or whatever else).

Step 03: Download Python, you can just google "Python download" on your browser, and the result should be from "www.python.org" (we installed Python 3.13); if you need a link it is "https://www.python.org/downloads/" (as of June 20, 2025, but the link could change).

Step 04: Run "python-x.x.x-x.exe", which was just downloaded. When setting up Python, make sure to check "Use admin privileges when installing py.exe" and "Add python.exe to PATH" on the initial window, then click "Install now".

Step 05: Open the windows command prompt (press the windows key and type "command prompt" then open it. You can also press the windows key + r, then type “cmd”, then press enter to open the command prompt)

Step 06: Type "cd downloads", press enter. We are trying to get the directory into the folder (called CCC-Project-main) where all the files from the GitHub repository are located.

Step 07: Type "cd CCC-Project-main", press enter.

Step 08: Type "dir", press enter. If there is another folder called "CCC-Project-main", type "cd CCC-Project-main" then press enter again.

Step 09: Type "pip install flask", press enter.

Step 10: Type "pip install fraction", press enter.

Step 11: Type "pip install beautifulsoup4", press enter.

Step 12: Type "python main.py", press enter. If a Windows Security Alert windows pops up, check Public networks and allow access (I don't know which one to choose to be honest)

Step 13: From the command prompt terminal, copy the second bullet point's link (something like "http://127.0.0.1:3000") into your browser.

Step 14: Now you should be able to use the website!
